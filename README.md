# Temporary Landing Page for PepperBot

This repository is for creating a temporary landing page for PepperBot website, deployed via GitHub Pages. The original creators of the deployment process used here are credited as gitname/react-gh-pages.

## Introduction

In this repository, we have a React app that serves as a temporary landing page for PepperBot. We have created this app using `create-react-app` and deployed it to GitHub Pages using `gh-pages`.

If you are following along with this guide, you'll end up with a temporary landing page for your project—hosted on GitHub Pages—which you can then customize. 

## How to Deploy Your React App to GitHub Pages

Please follow the instructions in the original readme [here](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

## Notes

- This repository is for creating a temporary landing page for PepperBot. It is a placeholder until the actual website is built and launched.
- Special thanks to the original creators [gitname/react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) for the detailed guide on deploying a React app to GitHub Pages.
- This repository consists of two branches: 
    - `master` - the _source code_ of the React app
    - `gh-pages` - the React app _built from_ that source code

<a href="https://github.com/____" target="_blank" title="____">
  <img src="https://github.com/____.png?size=40" height="40" width="40" alt="____" />
</a>

Instructions:
-------------

1. Copy the template and paste it below.
2. Replace the four "____" strings with the contributor's GitHub username.

Note: I specified the avatars using HTML because, when I did so using Markdown,
      only the _custom_ avatars appeared at the size I specified via the URL
      (e.g. 40px squared, for `https://github.com/gitname.png?size=40`);
      the GitHub-generated avatars seemed to ignore the size parameter and,
      instead, appear at their full size (approximately 420px squared...

Remember to add your GitHub contributors following the provided template.
